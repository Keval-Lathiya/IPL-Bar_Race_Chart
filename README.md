# Visualization of IPL(Indian Premier League) Wins from 2008-2023
This project provides a dynamic visualization of the total wins by each team in the Indian Premier League (IPL) over the years. It uses historical IPL data to create a Bar Race Chart, enhanced with the official logos of each team for a more engaging and informative visual experience.

### Description
These visualizations are created using two Python libraries **Manim** and **Bar Race Chart**. Manim is a powerful tool for mathematical animation created by Grant Sanderson, also known as 3Blue1Brown. The Bar Race Chart is a Python package to make an animated bar race chart, created by Ted Petrou. Initially, I used the Bar Race Chart library to create the visualization but it was not allowing me to add images to the bar, so I used Manim to create the desired visualization.

The logos of IPL teams were web-scraped from Wikipedia and integrated into the Bar Race Chart.

### Files
- **IPL_Wins.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook containing the script for generating the Bar Race Chart using the Manim and Bar Race Chart libraries.
